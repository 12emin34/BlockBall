Bossbar
=======

It is possible to display a bossbar during a match on a players screen. It looks like that:

You can use it to display team names, the remaining time, scores for each team and more. You can find all available placeholders here.

**Important!** If your server is on 1.8.9 or lower you need to install the plugin `BossBarAPI <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/7504/>`__
in order to use the Bossbar.

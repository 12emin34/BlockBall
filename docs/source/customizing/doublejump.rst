DoubleJump
==========

It is possible to use a double jump per default during a match. It looks like that:

You can use it to offer you players another way of moving around in the arena.

**Note:** You might need to adjust the horizontal strength value when your arena is bigger or smaller than the sample arena.

Configuring ingame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this stage, you should be able to open the `Settings <../gamemodes/basicgame.html#getting-in-touch-with-the-chat-ui>`__ page of your arena chat UI.

1. Go to the **Settings Page** of your arena
2. Open the **Abilities Page**
3. Open the **DoubleJump Page**

You can find all options explained at the bottom of this page.

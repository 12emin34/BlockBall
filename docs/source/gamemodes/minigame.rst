MiniGame
========

The Game Mode Minigame is a advanced game mode to use BlockBall as an ordinary Minigame. It contains a lobby and a max amount of time
a game can last. Also, players can only join before the match starts.

Make sure you created a base game first before you continue.

You need to change the GameType on the **Settings Page** to MiniGame before you continue!

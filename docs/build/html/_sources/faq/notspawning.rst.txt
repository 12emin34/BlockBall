The ball does not spawn?
========================

It is important to understand how BlockBall works in order to fix this problem. A BlockBall consist out of
2 entities, 2 **armorstands** .

Simply check if armorstands are allowed to spawn in your world or region and change these
settings if necessary. It is often easier to simple restrict mob spawning by using a game rule. **/gamerule doMobSpawning false**

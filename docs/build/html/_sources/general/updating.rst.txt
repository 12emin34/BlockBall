General
~~~~~~~

Please **carefully** read the update log on github before you download a new version of BlockBall!

The most messages and issues I receive are from players who forgot to read them, **do not become such a person as this holds me back from fixing actual issues**!

Upgrading from the previous to next version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apply the changes from the patchnotes if there are any changes mentioned.

If you are not capable of this you have to delete your old config.yml
in the BlockBall folder.


Upgrading from any version to the latest version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is highly recommend to read and apply **every update log** from the version you are currently using to the
version you want to use.

For example if you you are using BlockBall v4.0.1 and want to use BlockBall v4.1.1 you need to read the update log of
BlockBall v4.1.0 and BlockBall v4.1.1 and apply all changes.

If you do not care about your saves or your config the easiest way is to simple delete the BlockBall folder.

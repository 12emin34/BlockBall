HubGame
=======

The Game Mode HubGame is a simply game mode to provide players a small little area on your hub, lobby or overworld where
they can play soccer anytime without any restrictions or lobbies.

Make sure you created a `Base Game <../gamemodes/basicgame.html>`__ first before you continue.

As the default Game Mode is already a HubGame you do not have to configure anything at all. The Base Game is basically a HubGame.

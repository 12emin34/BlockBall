The easiest thing is to rate the plugin on spigotmc.org, planetminecraft.com or github.com. It encourages me to continue supporting BlockBall. :)

New feature idea? Bug report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All features the plugin is likely to receive in the future can be viewed at the `issues section of BlockBall <https://github.com/Shynixn/BlockBall/issues>`__.

The easiest option to suggest new features or report bugs is to submit a new issue there. However, I do also take reports from the spigot comment section or
private messages on spigot.

Developer? How can I customize BlockBall?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Take a look at setting up your personal `BlockBall workspace. <../api/index.html#setup-your-personal-blockball-workspace>`__

Holograms
=========

It is possible to display multiple holograms during a match all around of the arena. It looks like that:

.. image:: ../_static/images/hologram1.JPG

You can use it to display team names, the remaining time, scores for each team and more. You can find all available placeholders `here <placeholders.html>`__.

Holograms do even support multiple lines:

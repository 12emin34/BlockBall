<h5>Entering numbers in chat does not work?</h5>

<p>It is often the case that some Chat-Plugins especially Bungeecord Chat-Plugins do not handle
   chat messages correctly to be used with BlockBall. There are 2 options to solve this issue:
</p>

<b>Navigate via commands</b>

<p>This is the recommend option because you just have to change something in the BlockBall config.yml
   and does not interfere with other plugins.
</p>

<ul class="collection">
    <li class="collection-item">1. Open the config.yml of BlockBall and scroll down to <b>navigate-chatmenu</b>
    <li class="collection-item">2. Set <b>enabled to true</b> . Click here to find out more about dynamic commands</li>
    <li class="collection-item">3. Reload or restart your server. This setting <b>cannot</b> be applied via the
                                blockballreload command
    </li>
    <li class="collection-item">4. Open the chat menu via /blockball and start navigating by entering <b>/bbc
                                                                                                         [number]</b>
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Uninstall the Chat-Plugin</b>

<p>This might only be a good option if you really do not need the Chat-Plugin at all.

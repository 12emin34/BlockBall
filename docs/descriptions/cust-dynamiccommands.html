<h5>Dynamic commands</h5>

<p>BlockBall provides command settings a bit different than most other plugins. The author is the opinion that you
   should
   be in charge of deciding what the name and permission of the command is. </p>

<p>This is a sample setup how to change the global command setup from <b>/bbjoin [game-id/game-alias] [team] to /football
                                                                         [game-id/game-alias] [team]</b>.
   You can do the same with every defined command in the config.yml</p>

<ul class="collection">
    <li class="collection-item">1. Open the config.yml of BlockBall and scroll down to <b>global-join</b>
    <li class="collection-item">2. Make sure <b>enabled is set to true</b> and set <b>command to football</b></li>
    <li class="collection-item">3. Reload or restart your server. This setting <b>cannot</b> be applied via the
                                blockballreload command
    </li>
    <li class="collection-item">4. Try joining a game by entering <b>/football [game-id/game-alias] [team]</b>
    </li>
</ul>

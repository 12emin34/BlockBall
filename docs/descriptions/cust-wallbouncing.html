<h5>Wallbouncing</h5>

<p>A often requestet feature is that balls should "bounce" of walls. BlockBall has implemented such a thing but it requires some setup
before it is activated.</p>

<p>After this setup balls will no longer get stuck in corners.</p>

<ul class="collection">
    <li class="collection-item">1. Open your arena menu</li>
    <li class="collection-item">2. Open the menu <b>/Settings/General settings/Wall bouncing</b>
    <li class="collection-item">3. Find out the block-id and block-damage value of the wall of your arena. If you have more than one type of block simply repeat the following step.
    <li class="collection-item">4. Use the <b>Add block-type to bouncing</b> option and enter the id in the correct format
    <li class="collection-item">5. Save your arena <b>/Save arena</b>
    <li class="collection-item">6. Join the game and shoot the ball against a wall with the entered id and show if it bounces back from it.
    </li>
